    question: "Which of the following is NOT typically included in installation planning documentation?",
    options: [
      "Project charter",
      "Work breakdown structure",
      "Employee personal records",
      "Risk register"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Employee personal records",
    explanation: "Installation planning documentation includes project scopes, work structures, schedules, and risk assessments, but not personal employee information which is maintained separately for privacy and HR purposes."

    question: "What is the primary purpose of a site assessment in electrical installation planning?",
    options: [
      "To estimate the total project cost",
      "To identify existing conditions and constraints that will influence installation",
      "To hire the right number of workers",
      "To determine client payment schedules"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "To identify existing conditions and constraints that will influence installation",
    explanation: "Site assessment provides essential information about existing conditions, space constraints, environmental factors, and other variables that will impact how the installation should be approached."

    question: "When developing a schedule for an electrical installation, what does the Critical Path Method (CPM) help identify?",
    options: [
      "The most dangerous tasks in the project",
      "The tasks that directly impact the overall project duration",
      "The most expensive components to install",
      "The best electricians for each task"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "The tasks that directly impact the overall project duration",
    explanation: "The Critical Path Method identifies the sequence of dependent tasks that determine the shortest possible project duration. Any delay in critical path tasks will delay the entire project."

    question: "Which of the following is a key consideration in equipment and material selection for electrical installations?",
    options: [
      "Brand popularity",
      "Manufacturer's country of origin",
      "Technical specifications and compliance with standards",
      "Newest available technology regardless of requirements"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Technical specifications and compliance with standards",
    explanation: "Equipment and materials must meet technical specifications for the installation and comply with relevant standards and regulations to ensure safety, performance, and legal compliance."

    question: "What is the purpose of a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in installation planning?",
    options: [
      "To assign blame for project delays",
      "To decompose the project into manageable tasks",
      "To calculate worker compensation",
      "To determine which regulations apply to the project"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "To decompose the project into manageable tasks",
    explanation: "A Work Breakdown Structure hierarchically decomposes the total scope of work into smaller, more manageable components, making it easier to estimate, schedule, and track progress."

    question: "Which regulatory document is most relevant to electrical installations in the UK?",
    options: [
      "The Highway Code",
      "BS 7671 (Wiring Regulations)",
      "The Consumer Rights Act",
      "GDPR"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "BS 7671 (Wiring Regulations)",
    explanation: "BS 7671, commonly known as the Wiring Regulations, is the national standard in the UK for electrical installations, setting out requirements for electrical safety for the design, installation, inspection, and testing of electrical systems."

    question: "What is the primary benefit of resource-loaded scheduling in installation planning?",
    options: [
      "It increases the project budget",
      "It aligns task timing with resource availability",
      "It eliminates the need for skilled workers",
      "It reduces the need for quality control"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "It aligns task timing with resource availability",
    explanation: "Resource-loaded scheduling ensures that tasks are scheduled when the necessary resources (people, equipment, materials) are available, preventing delays due to resource conflicts or shortages."

    question: "In quality planning for electrical installations, what is the purpose of inspection and test plans (ITPs)?",
    options: [
      "To test new inspection methods",
      "To define when, where, and how inspections and tests will be performed",
      "To replace the need for qualified electricians",
      "To reduce project costs by eliminating quality checks"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "To define when, where, and how inspections and tests will be performed",
    explanation: "Inspection and Test Plans (ITPs) document the specific verification activities that will be performed at various stages of the installation to ensure quality and compliance with requirements."

    question: "What is the first step in the risk assessment process for electrical installations?",
    options: [
      "Implementing mitigation measures",
      "Risk identification",
      "Calculating insurance premiums",
      "Writing the final project report"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Risk identification",
    explanation: "Risk identification is the first step in the risk assessment process, where potential hazards and issues that could affect the project are systematically identified before they can be analyzed and addressed."

    question: "Which of the following would NOT typically be included in technical requirements analysis for an electrical installation?",
    options: [
      "Load calculations",
      "Compliance with regulations",
      "Employee vacation schedules",
      "System performance expectations"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Employee vacation schedules",
    explanation: "Technical requirements analysis focuses on performance specifications, standards compliance, and functional needs of the installation. Employee scheduling is part of resource planning, not technical requirements analysis."

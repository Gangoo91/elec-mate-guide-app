        Discrimination (or selectivity) is the coordination of protective devices to ensure that only 
        the device closest to a fault operates, minimizing disruption to the rest of the installation. 
        This enhances reliability and safety of electrical systems.

        <h4 className="font-medium text-[#FFC900] mb-2">What is Discrimination?</h4>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Discrimination occurs when a fault condition causes only the protective device closest to 
          the fault to operate, while all upstream devices remain closed.
        </p>
        <p>For example, in a home, if there is a fault on a socket circuit, ideally only the MCB 
          protecting that circuit should trip, not the main switch or upstream supplier's fuse.</p>

          <p className="mb-2">To achieve proper discrimination between protective devices:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Use an appropriate ratio between protective device ratings 
              (typically 1:1.5 to 1:2 between adjacent devices)</li>
            <li>Select devices from the same manufacturer's range designed for discrimination</li>
            <li>Consider using different device types at different levels (e.g., MCCBs for mains, MCBs for circuits)</li>
            <li>Implement time delays on upstream devices where appropriate</li>
            <li>Use RCBOs for individual circuits instead of a single RCD for multiple circuits</li>
          </ul>

        <h4 className="font-medium text-[#FFC900] mb-2">RCD Discrimination</h4>
        <p className="mb-2">
          For RCDs, discrimination can be achieved by:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Current rating: Upstream RCD should have at least 3 times the rated residual operating 
            current of the downstream RCD</li>
          <li>Time delay: Using time-delayed (S-type) RCDs upstream of instantaneous RCDs</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">Example arrangement:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Main incoming switchboard: 300mA time-delayed RCD</li>
          <li>Distribution boards: 100mA time-delayed RCDs</li>
          <li>Final circuits: 30mA instantaneous RCDs or RCBOs</li>

        <h4 className="font-medium text-[#FFC900] mb-2">Important Considerations</h4>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Full discrimination may not always be achievable, especially in smaller installations</li>
          <li>Manufacturer's data should be consulted for discrimination studies</li>
          <li>Critical circuits may require special consideration for discrimination</li>
          <li>Discrimination must never compromise safety of the installation</li>
          <li>Always verify discrimination during design stage using manufacturers' discrimination tables</li>
